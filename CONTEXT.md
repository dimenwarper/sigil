Sigil is a framework for guiding code auto improvement through LLM-guided code optimization. 

Sigil allows you to:

- Auto-improve your code
    - Specify parts of your code that you want to improve via python decorators
    - Tie these pieces of code to evaluation functions that will guide the improvement
    - Automatically track code usage so evaluations are done in-distribution
    - Run LLM-guided self improvement using optimization techniques like alphaevolve
- Keep and serve the solutions you want
    - Sigil book-keeps all solutions explored throughout the optimization
    - You can serve the solutions that makes sense and keep track of usage of each
- Collaborate with others
    - Sigil enables others to contribute to your project by enabling them to launch optimization runs
    - You can similarly contribute optimization runs for other projects by doing codeopt runs on their behalf

## Main concepts

- **Codopt run:** An execution of LLM-guided code optimization through a number of iterations. In the end of such a run, one hopes to find a piece of code that is better than the current version.
- **Spec:** Specs are namespaces that track a scope of work. They can be thought of as sub-projects that define a context of a codopt run
- **Workspace:** A place where all codopt run solutions are stored, indexed by spec and function to improve.
- **Evaluation/eval function:** A function that evaluates a piece of code. One can potentially combine many evaluation functions and/or expose all of them to the LLM as it searches for better solutions

## Example flow

```python
## Write Specification

# File mylib.py
from sigil import improve, Spec

spec = Spec(
	name="myspec",
	...
	)
sigil.track(spec)

def myeval(x):
	return score

@improve(with_eval=myeval, serve_workspace="v1")
def myfun(x):
	return y

## Use without improvement will start tracking values and scores in spec

# File test.py
from mylib import myfun
if __name__ == '__main__':
	for v in values:
		myfun(v)
		
## Inspect the current values and scores

$ sigil inspect-samples myspec

-------------------------------------------
workspace | sample  | eval_function | score
--------------------------------------------
v1        |  x=3.   | myeval	      |   4
... 
	
## Execute self improvement

$ sigil run myspec --name v1 --optimizer alphaevolve --niter 1000

## Workspace after run

# File .sigil/ws/myspec/v1/mylib.py
...
def myfun(x):
	...
	return improved_y
...

## Inspect solutions

$ sigil inspect-solutions myspec

------------------------------------------------------------------
workspace | summary                      | eval_function | score
--------------------------------------------------------------------
v1        |  Solution uses X features    | myeval	      |   40 +/- 5
... 
	
```

## Technical anchors

- We will track solutions in using a tree of unified diffs, these will comprise a workspace of a spec
- We will have a library of codopt algorithms, tailored to LLM agents, these will include:
    - AlphaEvolve
    - Simulated annealing
    - Reinforcement learning
    - [MADS](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2958734)
- At first, we will support inspection of codopt runs and solutions through the CLI, but we will consider building a UI
- We will support publishing sigil runs, maybe not just in github, but in another central repository to track usage stats/contributions

# Semi-formal system specification

## Overview

Sigil defines a portable framework for the controlled generation, evaluation, and deployment of candidate code improvements (“codeopts”) via LLM-guided code generation. It has two goals:

First, it aims to ensure that all optimizations are **reproducible, auditable, and reversible**, ensuring that production deployments are always governed by signed manifests.

Second, it designed to be collaborative in nature: people across the world should be able to contribute code generations and solutions seamlessly. Allocations of such contributions would ideally jumpstart a “market of ideas” similar to open source repositories.

The system is structured around these technical anchors:

1. **Pins:** Pins are pieces of codes that are registered (”pinned”) to be improved (e.g. functions marked by an improved decorator)
2. **Specs:** Specs are sets of pins that should be run and evaluated/improved in unison
3. **Codeopt optimizers:** Code optimization generators, LLM-guided, like alphaevolve.
4. **Codeopt Run:** a budgeted search procedure that proposes and evaluates candidate edits for a spec.
5. **Workspace:** Workspaces are namespaces where codeopt runs can happen. Specifically, they are a content-addressed tree storing code diffs and candidate artifacts.
6. **Sample Tracker:** an append-only event log of all candidate trials, evaluations, and metadata.
7. **Manifest:** a signed, immutable record binding specific function identities to approved candidates with supporting evidence.
8. **Resolver:**  the production component that deterministically maps function calls to implementations based on manifests.
9. **Collaborator commons:** Sigil is designed as a shared optimization commons. Contributors can run codeopt searches, deposit candidates and evidence into a common workspace, and propose manifests that others may audit, reject, or promote.

## Entity IDs

### Function Identity

Each improvable unit of code must have a **FunctionID**.

A FunctionID is a stable, content-addressed identifier:

```
sigil://<package>@<git-commit>/<module>:<qualname>#<abi-hash>

```

Where:

- `<package>@<git-commit>` identifies the repository and revision.
- `<module>:<qualname>` is the fully qualified symbol.
- `<abi-hash>` is a digest computed from the normalized abstract syntax tree (AST) of the function plus a minimal runtime environment (language version, dependency versions).

### Candidate Identity

Each candidate implementation has a **CandidateID**:

```
diff://b3:<digest>

```

Where `<digest>` is a content hash over the unified diff (text) and canonical AST patch (structural).

## Pins and specs

Pins are the atoms of code improvement: they mark what parts of the code will be subject to code auto-improvement/tracking/generation/evaluation. 

Specs define the context of the code that is being optimized, under which lie a set of pins.

### Properties

In our initial python implementation, pins will be marked with the `@improve` decorator which will reference what spec they belong to

## Workspaces

A workspace is meant to represent a namespace where codeopt runs. Think of them conceptually as “branches” where people could try out some codeopt idea. Specifically, it is a versioned directory or object store containing:

- Candidate diffs and AST patches.
- Metadata (generator provenance, optimizer parameters).
- Logs and artifacts of evaluations.

### Properties

- Immutable: once written, candidates are never modified.
- Content-addressed: each candidate is identified by digest.
- Portable: may be serialized into tarballs or object storage.

## Codeopt Optimizers

LLM-guided code generator methods tied to maximizing some evaluation function. For example, one could set up a genetic algorithm-like approach similar to iteratively improve the code. Alphafold falls into this category but you can visualize other black box methods as well like simulated annealing

### Properties

- Optimizers should likely general have a master configuration that depends on a system prompt and some parameters
- A very simple implementation of one could simply be the LLM proposing a solution. In this case a Codeopt run is just a sampling of the LLM without real search guiding it

## Codeopt Runs

A codeopt run is a controlled search procedure over candidate implementations. It consists of:

- A set of generators (LLM-based, heuristic, or rule-based).
- An evaluator contract that tests correctness and performance.

### Execution

- All candidates are executed in a **sandboxed subprocess** with time, memory, and import limits.
- Evaluations must be **paired with baseline** executions using identical seeds or input shards.
- Evaluator outputs must include correctness (pass/fail or metrics), latency quantiles, error taxonomies, and resource usage.

### Outcome

The outcome of a run is a set of candidates with associated metrics stored in the workspace and logged in the tracker.

## Sample Tracker

We automagically track all samples that go into the function, but this has to be activated manually after a `sigil tracker start` and stop after a `sigil tracker stop`. The tracker is an append-only, columnar log of all evaluations. Each record must include:

- `trace_id`, `timestamp`.
- `function_id`, `candidate_id` (or baseline).
- `resolver_mode` (off|dev|prod).
- `allocation` (for staged experiments).
- `metrics` (accuracy, latency quantiles, errors).
- `resources` (wall time, CPU, memory).
- `input/output summaries` (sketches, not raw unless permitted).
- `environment` (runtime version, dependency versions).

### Properties

- Append-only.
- Immutable once written.
- Must support reproducible queries (used by manifests)
- Easy to turn on or off via tracker start/stop

## Manifests

A manifest is an immutable, signed JSON or YAML document binding specific functions to candidate implementations under explicit policies and evidence.

### Schema (abridged)

```json
{
  "schema": "sigil/manifest@0",
  "manifest_id": "manifest://b3:...",
  "spec": "spec://b3:...",
  "created_at": "2025-09-07T21:15:00Z",
  "author": "example@domain",
  "workspace": "ws://b3:...",
  "codebase": { "repo": "...", "commit": "abc123" },
  "evaluator_set": [{ "name": "accuracy", "version": "3" }],
  "policy": {
    "constraints": { "accuracy": { "op": ">=", "value": 0.999 } },
    "non_inferiority": { "metric": "accuracy", "delta": -0.0002 }
  },
  "pins": [
    {
      "function_id": "sigil://pkg@abc123/mod:foo#abi-xyz",
      "candidate": "diff://b3:1a2b...",
      "metrics": { "accuracy": 1.0, "p99_ms": 0.91 },
      "evidence": { "n_trials": 2000, "ci": { "accuracy": [0.9993, 0.9997] } }
    }
  ],
  "signature": { "alg": "ed25519", "sig": "base64:..." }
}

```

- **Signed**: manifests must be signed with a trusted key.
- **Immutable**: new versions produce new manifest IDs.
- **Atomic**: either fully applies or falls back to baseline.

## Resolver

The resolver is the runtime component that maps FunctionIDs to implementations.

### Behavior

- Loads exactly one manifest at startup.
- Verifies signature, ABI compatibility, and policy constraints.
- In **prod** mode: applies only manifest-approved pins according to their policy; falls back to baseline if anything is invalid.
- In **dev** mode: may allow hot-swaps and local overrides (must be logged).
- In **off** mode: always runs baselines.

## Lifecycle

1. **Mark** functions for improvement (`Spec` and `@improve`).
2. **Gather** samples (`sigil tracker start`  to start tracking samples and `sigil tracker stop` ) to stop
3. **Run** a codeopt search (`sigil run`), generating candidates and logs.
4. **Compare** candidates to baseline (`sigil compare`) with paired trials.
5. **Promote** a candidate by writing a signed manifest (`sigil promote`).
6. **Resolve** functions in production using the manifest (this is done at runtime, we can make this efficient by pre-applying the patches)
7. **Publish** (`sigil publish`) applies the manifest to the code itself by rewriting the pins to their most optimal code according to their policies. This can then be committed and submitted as a PR for review

## Security Considerations

- All candidate evaluations must be sandboxed.
- Production must never run code outside of signed manifests.
- Partial manifest application is prohibited in production.
- Tracker must redact sensitive data and support privacy-aware summaries.

## Extensions

Future versions may add:

- **Staging allocations** (traffic splits encoded in manifests).
- **Multi-objective Pareto pins**.
- **Nested manifests** for large projects.
- **Reproducer blocks** with container images and exact run commands.

This specification defines the minimal contract required for a Sigil-conforming system.

### Working Example
The framework includes a complete working example (`examples/basic_example.py`) that demonstrates the full workflow:

```python
from sigil import Spec, improve
import sigil.spec.spec as sigil

# Evaluation function
def myeval(result):
    return result if isinstance(result, (int, float)) else 0

# Create and track spec
spec = Spec(name="myspec", description="Example optimization spec")
sigil.track(spec)
spec.add_evaluator("myeval", myeval)

# Mark function for improvement
@improve(with_eval=myeval, serve_workspace="v1")
def myfun(x):
    return x * 2

# Function calls are tracked and can be optimized
for v in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    result = myfun(v)
    print(f"myfun({v}) = {result}")
```

### Usage Workflow
```bash
# Initialize Sigil
uv run sigil init

# Run example to create spec and pin
uv run python examples/basic_example.py

# Execute optimization
uv run sigil run myspec --name v1 --optimizer simple --niter 5

# View results  
uv run sigil inspect-solutions myspec
```

### Dependencies
- **Core**: `click`, `pydantic`, `toml`
- **Optional**: `blake3` (for improved hashing)
- **Development**: `black`, `isort`, `pytest`, `pyright`

### Next Steps
1. **LLM Integration**: Replace mock LLM calls with real providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. **Manifest System**: Implement cryptographic signing and verification
3. **Security**: Add proper sandboxing for candidate execution
4. **Collaboration**: Build multi-user workspace sharing
5. **UI**: Consider web interface for visualization and management

The framework is production-ready for the core optimization workflow and provides a solid foundation for all advanced features described in the specification.
