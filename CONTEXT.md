# Sigil: **A framework for auto-improving code**

![image.png](attachment:1c57b5e2-1b4e-4046-b28e-482060789a03:image.png)

Sigil is a framework for guiding code auto improvement through LLM-guided code optimization. 

Sigil allows you to:

- Auto-improve your code
    - Specify parts of your code that you want to improve via python decorators
    - Tie these pieces of code to evaluation functions that will guide the improvement
    - Automatically track code usage
    - Run LLM-guided self improvement using optimization techniques like alphaevolve
- Keep and serve the solutions you want
    - Sigil book-keeps all solutions explored throughout the optimization
    - You can serve the solutions that makes sense and keep track of usage of each
- Collaborate with others
    - Sigil enables others to contribute to your project by enabling them to launch optimization runs
    - You can similarly contribute optimization runs for other projects

## Main concepts

- **Codopt run:** An execution of LLM-guided code optimization through a number of iterations. In the end of such a run, one hopes to find a piece of code that is better than the current version.
- **Spec:** Specs are namespaces that track a scope of work. They can be thought of as sub-projects that define a context of a codopt run
- **Workspace:** A place where all codopt run solutions are stored, indexed by spec and function to improve.
- **Evaluation/eval function:** A function that evaluates a piece of code. One can potentially combine many evaluation functions and/or expose all of them to the LLM as it searches for better solutions

## Example flow

```
## Write Specification

# File mylib.py
from sigil import improve, Spec

spec = Spec(
	name="myspec",
	...
	)
sigil.track(spec)

def myeval(x):
	return score

@improve(with_eval=myeval, serve_workspace="v1")
def myfun(x):
	return y

## Use without improvement will start tracking values and scores in spec

# File test.py
from mylib import myfun
if __name__ == '__main__':
	for v in values:
		myfun(v)
		
## Inspect the current values and scores

$ sigil inspect-samples myspec

-------------------------------------------
workspace | sample  | eval_function | score
--------------------------------------------
v1        |  x=3.   | myeval	      |   4
... 
	
## Execute self improvement

$ sigil run myspec --name v1 --optimizer alphaevolve --niter 1000

## Workspace after run

# File .sigil/ws/myspec/v1/mylib.py
...
def myfun(x):
	...
	return improved_y
...

## Inspect solutions

$ sigil inspect-solutions myspec

------------------------------------------------------------------
workspace | summary                      | eval_function | score
--------------------------------------------------------------------
v1        |  Solution uses X features    | myeval	      |   40 +/- 5
... 
	
```

## Technical anchors

- We will track solutions in using a tree of unified diffs, these will comprise a workspace of a spec
- We will have a library of codopt algorithms, tailored to LLM agents, these will include:
    - AlphaEvolve
    - Simulated annealing
    - Reinforcement learning
    - [MADS](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2958734)
- At first, we will support inspection of codopt runs and solutions through the CLI, but we will consider building a UI
- We will support publishing sigil runs, maybe not just in github, but in another central repository to track usage stats/contributions

## Implementation Status (as of 2025-09-05)

**‚úÖ Completed Core Framework:**

- **Package Structure:** Full Python package managed with uv, including pyproject.toml with dependencies (click, pydantic, toml) and dev tools (pytest, black, isort, pyright, pre-commit)
- **Core Components:** 
  - `Spec` class for managing specifications/namespaces with workspace management
  - `@improve` decorator for marking functions for optimization with evaluation tracking
  - `FunctionTracker` for capturing function calls, inputs, outputs, and evaluation scores
  - Global `track()` function for registering specs
- **Workspace System (`Workspaces` class):**
  - Solution storage with metadata in JSON format
  - Code storage with organized directory structure (`.sigil/ws/spec/workspace/`)
  - Unified diff generation between original and optimized code
  - Best solution retrieval based on evaluation scores
  - Workspace export functionality
- **CLI Interface (`sigil` command):**
  - `inspect-samples` - View collected function call samples and scores
  - `inspect-solutions` - View optimized solutions (basic implementation)
  - `run` - Execute optimization with specified algorithm and iterations
- **Optimization Algorithms:**
  - `LLMSampler` - Basic LLM-based code variation generator (placeholder implementation)
  - Extensible optimizer framework with abstract base class
- **Example Usage:** Complete working example in `examples/basic_usage.py` demonstrating all features

**üöß Current Limitations:**
- LLM integration is placeholder (no actual API calls yet)
- Code execution and evaluation is simulated 
- Solution serving from workspaces not fully integrated
- Advanced algorithms (AlphaEvolve, SA, RL) not implemented yet
